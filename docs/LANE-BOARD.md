# ACGC visible lane board

Updated 2026-08-12 under the rolling-refill scheduler. The board records the
visible Codex tasks, their ownership, and the order in which evidence may be
integrated. All new and successor tasks are Luna Max with max reasoning. A
task being active means it is allowed to inspect or run its bounded work; it
does not mean its gate passed.

## Ownership and live state

| # | Lane / visible task ID | Ownership | Worktree / branch | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

The Codex-created umbrella worktrees begin detached at umbrella commit
`82732fe` with nested submodules uninitialized. Source-edit lanes therefore use
the explicit source worktrees listed above. No lane should initialize nested
submodules blindly or edit a detached source checkout.

## Evidence already integrated

- `9b1c48f` / `3a6582d` are integrated on `c1/macos-host-launch`; the SDL/CoreAudio
  boundary and CARD host-transfer probes pass, but they do not prove audible
  mixer output or GameCube Save_t/GCI persistence.
- `e5442de` adds the injectable, fixed-width PC input snapshot boundary; its
  focused source test passed. `858d802` now routes the exact final `PADRead`
  handoff through that snapshot and passes native plus ASan/UBSan tests. The
  same visible task is now running a separate SDL event-path smoke successor;
  no live keyboard/controller or game interaction is claimed.
- `e03ffed` adds a pointer-free graph submission capture seam; its focused
  legacy test and Darwin graph syntax check pass, but the current run reaches
  neither the hook nor a live packet.
- `83fa889` is the integrated renderer-neutral GX packet contract. It is a
  4,800-byte fixed-width packet with strict malformed-input rejection; native,
  Apple-entrypoint, and ASan/UBSan focused tests pass. It is not live-game
  evidence.
- `866dd94` adds Metal geometry/state fixtures. CPU and existing geometry tests
  pass; the offscreen Metal test is skipped because this host reports no Metal
  device.
- `ddbb498` adds fixed-width texture/TLUT/sampler/TEV fixtures, including
  CI14x2 and CMPR reference cases. The integrated Apple fixture test passes;
  no texture upload/readback, shader wiring, or game-renderer evidence is
  claimed.
- `766ad96` adds a synthetic probe through `Jac_VframeWork`,
  `MixInterleaveTrack`, `AIInitDMA`, and the SDL callback. Exact PCM and ring
  drain pass natively and under ASan; no device/audible proof is claimed.
- Umbrella evidence commits `15a081f`, `ee7b814`, and `fe21878` record
  synthetic lifecycle, sandboxed atomic-save, and arm64/sanitizer matrix gates.
- Umbrella commit `3b8ed21` records Save_t/GCI layout and codec evidence:
  canonical padding round-trips, but a high-entropy fixture loses two bytes of
  allocation padding at Save_t offset `0xB6`; exact-file-length, runtime
  restart, main/backup recovery, and whole-GCI losslessness remain open.
- The Windows audit found no regression in `4f77dab` and preserves the x86
  guards, but no MinGW/i686 compiler is installed. Two pre-existing POSIX
  include assumptions remain follow-up checks.
- `dfb3f7f` is integrated as `4f77dab`: the PC disc-backed DVD host accepts the
  GameCube 32-byte sector-tail transfer for 19-byte `COPYDATE` while rejecting
  malformed ranges. Native and ASan/UBSan focused probes pass.
- A fresh arm64 run against the DVD lane reaches `COPYDATE`, string-table
  completion, `JW_Init2`, `HotStartEntry`, both forest archives, and Famicom
  archive loading, then stops at `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `game.c:154` while entering
  `graph_proc`. This is not a rendered-frame proof.
- The completed boot trace resolves the failing arm64 store as
  `strb w8, [x22,#0x474]` for `GRAPH_SET_DOING_POINT(graph, GAME_BGM)` with
  computed bad base `0x100000000`; `graph_task_set00` is never hit. Its next
  source successor owns only `src/game.c`, `include/graph.h`, and directly
  necessary ABI/callback tests on `c1/lane-graph-fault`.

## Integration order

1. Keep the graph-fault successor on the post-loader fault. Inspect the bad
   `GRAPH_SET_DOING_POINT` destination/object lifetime at `game.c:154`; do not
   claim a frame until the run reaches `graph_task_set00` and the capture
   callback records one packet.
2. When a lane completes, inspect its final evidence immediately, mark it
   integrated/rejected/parked here, and refill only with a useful dependency-ready
   successor. Current successor: input snapshot runtime gate on the same branch.
3. After the graph fault is repaired, run the capture seam (`e03ffed`) and feed
   the first live packet into `83fa889`; only then advance Metal/TEV toward a
   game-owned frame. The `866dd94` and `ddbb498` fixture passes remain separate
   gates.
4. Treat Save_t/GCI as blocked on the explicit padding mismatch until the
   codec preserves arbitrary bytes or defines a proven wire-format boundary;
   do not weaken the roundtrip test. Filesystem adapter, lifecycle, and
   verification evidence remain synthetic/portable boundaries.
5. Re-run the native and sanitizer matrix at the integrated `c1/macos-host-launch`
   source HEAD, then separately prove input, audio device/audibility, save/load,
   simulator, physical device, and playability.
6. iOS implementation remains gated behind proven shared macOS core, renderer,
   input, audio, persistence, and lifecycle behavior.

No lane may push, publish, deploy, install, sign, submit, or redistribute the
ISO, extracted assets, keys, or proprietary game data.
